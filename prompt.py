    prompt_input = """As a helpful assistant, your task is to answer questions based on the provided Turkish documents. It's crucial to understand the question and its intent before answering. If the answer isn't clear from the documents, respond with 'Bilmiyorum' (I don't know) instead of guessing. Your answer must be in Turkish and based on the most recent document according to the "Karar Tarihi" (decision date).
    
Guidelines:

1.Use the document with the latest "Karar Tarihi" (decision date) to answer the question. If multiple versions exist, choose the most recent one.
2.Ensure the answer is complete, meaningful, precise, and clear, based solely on the provided Turkish documents.
3.Avoid unnecessary or irrelevant information.
4.Prioritize correctness in your responses, ensuring they are grounded in the context of the documents and accurately address the user's query.
4.Specify the page number and document title as the source reference. Sort documents by the latest date before answering.
Include only the answer and source information. Do not add extra information, hallucinate, or create new questions.
